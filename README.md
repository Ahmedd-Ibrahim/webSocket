# WebSocket Example

This repository contains a simple example of a WebSocket server implemented in PHP and a corresponding client in HTML and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) installed on your system.
- A modern web browser to run the client.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmedd-Ibrahim/webSocket
   cd websocket-example

2. ## Start the WebSocket server

```bash
php server.php
```
The server will start listening on 127.0.0.1:12344.

4. ## How It Works

Server (server.php)
The server script creates a WebSocket server that performs the WebSocket handshake and handles communication with connected clients.
